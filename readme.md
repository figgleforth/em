### Motivations
- Some features and syntax that I like and think would be cool
- I want to type as little as possible, so no need for `class`/`var` prefixes because capitalization determines the
  construct
- As few reserved words as possible. I want to be able to use any name
- Integrated documentation where a documentation directory and pages are automatically created from specific comment
  syntax
- Web app focused, so server and MVC constructs as standard features
  - The ultimate goal is to create web apps without external libraries like how one might use Rails with Ruby

A few samples of the syntax from `tests/cli.em`. You can run it with `ruby source/cli/cli.rb tests/cli.em`
```
Boo {
    scary = 1234
}

moo { boo ->
	boo.scary
}
>! moo(Boo.new) == 1234 # true

moo_with_comp { &boo_param ->
    scary * 2
}
>! moo_with_comp(Boo.new) == 2468 # true

x = 1;

result = if x == 2 {
  'yes'
else
  'no'
}

boo = 'does interpolation work yet? `result`'
>! boo + ' .. apparently not'

>! 'x before while loop ' + x
while x < 5 {
  x = x + 1
  >! 'x became ' + x
elswhile x < 10 {
  x = x + 2
  >! "This won't print!"
}
>! 'x after while loop ' + x

CONSTANT = 42

get_constant { multiplier = 1.6 ->
	multiplier ** multiplier * CONSTANT
}

>! 1.6 ** 1.6 * 42
>! 'constant: ' + get_constant
>! get_constant(2)

greet_with_arg { name -> 'hello `name`' }
greet_with_label { for name -> 'Mister `name`' }

>! greet_with_arg('Eko')
>! greet_with_label(for: 'Eko')

Some_Class {
  nothing =;

  something = { x y z }

  inspect { ->
    "I am some class"
  }
}

some = Some_Class.new
>! some.something # { x: nil, y: nil, z: nil }
>! some.inspect

```
