### Custom operators thought experiment

I want to write `time = 11:11pm` and get back a `Time` instance.
```
Time {
   hour
   minute
   meridian
   
   MERIDIAN {
      AM,
      PM
   }
   
   operator infix : { left, right ->
      `pretend type-checking for a Number instances
      Time.tap {
         it.hour = left
         it.minute = right
      }
   }
   
   operator postfix pm { left ->
      `more pretend type-checking for a Time instance
      left.meridian = MERIDIAN.PM
      left
   }
}

#Time `localize Time scope, giving you access to the : operator
time = 11:22pm `Time(11:22pm)
time.hour `11
time.minute `22
time.meridian `pm
-#Time `remove Time scope
```
The reason this operator needs a `left` and `right` argument is because if it were declared on an instance of `Time` then it would only need a `right`, and it would need to be used on a `Time` instance. But in this form, you supply it both sides, and that lets you perform `Time` operations on non-`Time` instances.

I think `-#Class` is cool syntax, the implication is that it cancels out the `#Class`. Scoping and descoping expressions should be ignored as a return value, similar to how Ruby ignores comments. This is important because the last expression in any block is it's return value.

What about syntax for differentiating between this operator on `Time` instances or on two non-`Time` instances? I want to use the language structure itself is a form of configuration, so the context in which the operator is used depends on the params declared.

- `{left->}` means `./` is the right side, therefore this is called on an instance
- `{right->}` means `./` is the left side, also called on an instance
- `{left,right->}` means this operator takes two instances

```
Time {
   operator infix : { left -> }
   operator infix : { right -> }
   operator infix : { left, right -> }
}
```
Using the previous code as an example to explain. When `:` is used, the declaration with both `left` and `right` will be called. 
```
Time.now : 15 `called on instance
16 : Time.now `called on instance

#Time
11:22pm
-#Time
```
---
I imagine this could be powerful.
```
Time {
   operator infix : { left, right ->
      if left is Time
         left.second = right
      else
         Time.tap {
            it.hour = left
            it.minute = right
         }
      }
   }
}

Time.now `1:08pm

#Time
now.hour:22 `makes 1:22pm
11:now.minute `makes 11:08pm
now:42 `makes 1:08:42pm
-#Time
```
